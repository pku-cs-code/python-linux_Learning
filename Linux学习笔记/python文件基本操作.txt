file_obj = file("文件路径"，"模式")
file_obj = open（"文件路径"，"模式"）

r  只读
w  只用于写入
a  用于追加
w+ 写读（一般不用）

obj.read()  一次性加载所有内容到内存
obj.readlines()  一次性加载所有内容到内存，并根据行分割成字符串
for line in obj:  每次只读一行
	print line
obj.write(‘内容’)
obj.close()

write是覆盖，会冲掉原来的内容

python2可以用print f.read()，print f.readlines()，python3不可以
print f.readlines()

>>> f = open("test.log","r")
>>> print f.readlines()
['This is the first line\n', 'This is the 2nd line\n', 'This is the 3rd line\n', 'This is the 4th line\n']
>>> f.close()
>>> f = open("test.log","r")

>>> for line in f:
...     print line
... 
This is the first line

This is the 2nd line

This is the 3rd line

This is the 4th line

>>> f.close
<built-in method close of file object at 0x7f41f4573c00>

#加逗号可以防止空行

>>> f = open("test.log","r")
>>> for line in f:
...     print line,
... 
This is the first line
This is the 2nd line
This is the 3rd line
This is the 4th line


>>> f = open("test.log","r")
>>> for line in f:
...     if "3" in line:
...             print "this is the third line"
...     else:
...             print line ,
... 
This is the first line
This is the 2nd line
this is the third line
This is the 4th line
>>> f.close
<built-in method close of file object at 0x7f41f4573c00>
